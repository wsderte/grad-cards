            Duck is the common name for numerous species in the waterfowl family
            Anatidae which also includes swans and geese. Ducks are divided
            among several subfamilies in the family Anatidae; they do not
            represent a monophyletic group (the group of all descendants of a
            single common ancestral species) but a form taxon, since swans and
            geese are not considered ducks. Ducks are mostly aquatic birds,
            mostly smaller than the swans and geese, and may be found in both
            fresh water and sea water.
